    "description": "The best thing about skateboarding is traveling to new destinations you've never seen or skated before. It\u2019s almost the same feeling as when you open your front door and jump on your skateboard for the first time. Not knowing where you're going with no destination in mind. You just believe wherever you're headed, it will be the best time ever, because you have four wheels under your feet.\n\nSee the riders from Arbor's Whiskey Team as they embark through the Colorado area hitting everything in their path. Join Cameron Revier, Alec Beck, Sam Baker and Sean Imes in this tour segment from Arbor Skateboards.\n\nFilm: Florin Mezza\nEdit: Nate Shute\nMusic: The Seeds \u201cPushin\u2019 Too Hard\"\n\nTo learn more about Arbor Skateboards visit: http:\/\/arborcollective.com\/skateboards\/",
