    "transcripts": "I started playing the drums when I was 13 years old, lived in Sydney Australia played in a lot of bands growing up and there was one show that a band played where we supported the Food Fighters and I was like 18 years old and they gave me a shout out in the middle of their show and it just blew my little mind. Kind of felt like an endorsement for me to just put my head down and really properly do that. You know I moved to America when I was 20 years old and basically being kind of on tour and playing professionally since then. The collaborative experience of playing music on stage is such a present thing I say it as like a wonderful thing that I get to do my impetus for playing music changes drastically all the time even if it's totally unnoticeable to anyone else I feel like I'm thinking about like what's the point of all this cause when it's an ego game it's very short lived, so whether it's fame or respectable or adoration or technical prowess or any of that kind of stuff it it takes you away from the soul of why you play music and why you make art.",
