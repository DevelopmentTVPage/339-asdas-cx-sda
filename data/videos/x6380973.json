    "description": "The single \"Augustina\" by Coyotes is this week's \"Track of the Week\". After one of their mothers applied Coyotes' for a session, the band was thrilled when they were given the opportunity to record at Rubber Tracks Studio in S\u00e3o Paulo. Though they had recorded their music in the past, Coyotes was excited to utilize the extensive assortment of gear that the professional studio had to offer. The resulting song from the band's Rubber Tracks session sounded better than they imagined.\nFor more on Converse Rubber Tracks visit: www.converse.com\/rubbertracks",
