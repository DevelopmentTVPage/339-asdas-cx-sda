    "description": "The locals wouldn\u2019t stop talking about how it was one of the coldest winters in the past century. That didn\u2019t stop the Arbor Snowboards crew consisting of Brandon Hammid, Mike Liddle, Mike Gray, and LP Dorval from exploring the frozen city in search of new spots, never been done tricks, and good times. Visiting a city that is so steeped in snowboard history is not only challenging but inspiring and the crew rose the occasion, breaking ground and ice to bring you Video Log: Quebec.\u00a0\n\nUn grand merci \u00e0 the Nowamean crew and Frank April for showing us around the city and being so hospitable.",
