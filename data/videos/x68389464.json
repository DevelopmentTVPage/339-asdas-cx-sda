    "transcripts": "When I first started skateboarding like when I go to a park my parents would have liked bribe me to stop skating. I just wanted to skate every day it's all I wanted to do yeah I was six years old when I told my parents I wanted to be a pro skater. I think they didn't take me that serious but then at the same time they're kinda like well whatever he wants to do let's do it. I think once I got on like flip skateboards that's kind of like the point where everything kinda became more serious, it's funny cause I was only like 13. Yeah my motivation today just comes from me choosing a path and skateboarding and just that's what I'm gonna do for the rest of my life. It's hard being nineteen to think about what it's gonna be like when I'm older. I try not to really think about the future. Yeah basically what I would tell like a little kid like how I was just basically like do whatever you want to do. Surrounding yourself with good people and people that will guide you just having that guide it's kind of everything.",
