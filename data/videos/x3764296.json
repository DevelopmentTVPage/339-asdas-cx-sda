The smells of candy floss, the bright lights and the rush of excitement as you spin round and round on the fairground carousel - climb aboard your beautiful horse and hold tight! Relive the thrills of the fair with 'Hold Your Horses', our beautiful vintage style children's tent.\n\nA matching Little Campers play mat is also available for an additional \u00a365, in our stylish Black Magic Classic Colour.\n\nLittle Campers are easy to assemble, UV fade resistant and 100% waterproof; when pegged down, they are suitable to be left in the garden all year round or can be lifted inside for an indoor play tent with no need to peg it down.
